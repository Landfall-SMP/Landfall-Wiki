## Overview

Cornflower stood as a beacon of elegance and prosperity within [[Lilarreich]], renowned for its lush landscapes and vibrant cultural life. The city attracted the nation’s elite, offering a retreat from the political intensity of [[Terranova]]. Cornflower’s economy thrived on commerce and artisanal industries, with markets filled with goods from across [[Caldora]]. Its unpaved streets were sparsely lined with galleries, farms, and cafes, making it a center for artistic and intellectual exchange. The city’s serene environment also drew diplomatic organizations and traders such as [[The Guild]], further solidifying its role as a lesser-known hub for cultural and economic activity.
