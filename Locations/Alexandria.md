## Overview

Situated the furthest from [[Terranova]], Alexandria was a [[Lilarreich]] military outpost tasked with safeguarding the nationâ€™s frontiers. Its military installations and strategic position allowed it to monitor and repel external threats, serving as a critical defensive stronghold even if [[Terranova]] were to fall. During the height of the Great Dominion, Alexandria was heavily garrisoned and became a staging ground for numerous military campaigns. Beyond its martial role, the outpost supported logistical operations, ensuring the efficient movement of troops and supplies across the region.
