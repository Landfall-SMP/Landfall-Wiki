## Overview

Varenholde, formerly the [[Zatrian National Republic]], is a duchy within the [[Ehrengard Empire]], governed by Duke [[Klein Moretti]]. It was won in the [[ZNR-Ehrengard Conflict]]. Located in the arid and rugged [[Emberscar Basin]], Varenholde reflects a complex blend of its Zatrian heritage and the ideals of Ehrengard. Though its integration into the Empire was a contentious process, Varenholde has since flourished as a center for military strategy and resource development.
