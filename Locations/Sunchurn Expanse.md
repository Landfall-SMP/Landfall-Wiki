## Overview

A vast and harsh desert, the Sunchurn Expanse is a land where the sun beats down
relentlessly, baking the sands and rock beneath it. This desert was once home to ancient civilizations, now long buried beneath dunes and forgotten by time. Legends say that the energy of the sun itself fuels the sands, and some believe that the heat is a divine test of endurance.

Only the strongest survive in the Expanse, and those who do find themselves shaped by its unforgiving nature. It is home to [[Mirage Concord]].
