## Overview

The Asylum, built by [[Willy Luditus]], stands as a stark reminder of [[Caldora]]’s tumultuous past. Situated adjacent to both [[Terranova]] and [[Rotatus Island]], the facility serves as a refuge for those deemed unstable or dangerous, offering both isolation and the opportunity for rehabilitation.

## Purpose and Structure

The Asylum was constructed as part of Luditus’s penance for his role in the courthouse bombing following [[XreaTech vs. Walrus Luditus]]. It features reinforced chambers, meditation gardens, and a central hall for group therapy sessions. The facility balances security with comfort, aiming to rehabilitate rather than simply contain its residents.
