## Overview

A tranquil and mysterious region, Fellsong Valley is known for the haunting melodies carried on the wind. These ancient songs are said to be echoes of lost souls, ancient gods, or perhaps even Sylhara ([[Weavers of the Verdant Thread]]) herself, drawing in wanderers and seekers of hidden knowledge.
