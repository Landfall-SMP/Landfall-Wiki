## Overview

Carved into a mountainside along [[Terranova]]’s border, Crazy Cave was the hideout of [[Crazy Eli]], a notorious figure during the Great Dominion. The cave was created with the infamous [[Crazy Cannon]] and featured various machines. Despite its chaotic origin, Crazy Cave served as a base of operations for Eli’s unpredictable exploits such as experimental weaponry tests. It remains a testament to Eli’s ingenuity and eccentricity.
