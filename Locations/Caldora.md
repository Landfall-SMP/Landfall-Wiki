#### 1. [[Sunchurn Expanse]]

A vast and relentless desert, the Sunchurn Expanse is a region of blistering heat and shifting sands. Once home to ancient civilizations, its ruins now lie buried beneath towering dunes, their secrets whispered only by the wind. Legends tell of a divine connection to the sun, with the searing heat serving as a trial of endurance and strength. Survival here shapes its inhabitants into resilient, resourceful individuals, with only the toughest managing to endure the Expanse's harsh embrace.
#### 2. [[Stormcradle Peaks]]

Towering mountains perpetually shrouded in storms, the Stormcradle Peaks are believed to be remnants of ancient divine battles. Lightning and fierce winds dominate the jagged cliffs, making passage treacherous and the peaks largely uninhabitable. However, the lower ridges have become a haven for the Umbral Communion, who use the shadows of the storm to seek hidden truths. Despite the dangers, the Peaks remain a place of intrigue and power for those daring enough to traverse them.
#### 3. [[Fellsong Valley]]

A serene yet mysterious region, Fellsong Valley is famous for the eerie melodies carried on its winds. These haunting songs are said to be the voices of lost souls or perhaps whispers from the goddess Sylhara. Drawn by these ancient harmonies, wanderers and seekers come to Fellsong Valley in search of enlightenment, believing that its melodies hold the keys to forgotten knowledge and hidden truths.
#### 4. [[The Frozen Mantle]]

An icy wasteland locked in eternal winter, the Frozen Mantle is a place of unyielding cold and stillness. Its frozen expanse resists change, embodying timeless endurance. Only the hardiest settlers live here, carving out a meager existence in defiance of nature’s unforgiving grip. The Weavers of the Verdant Thread revere the Frozen Mantle as a symbol of quiet resilience, where dormant life waits patiently beneath the snow, poised for the moment of renewal.
#### 5. [[Emberscar Basin]]

A volatile land of molten rock and smoldering ruins, the Emberscar Basin is shaped by ancient volcanic activity. Its fiery landscape is a dangerous but potent source of raw power, long used by the followers of the Conclave of the Silent Forge. Ruined forges dot the land, bearing testament to the Basin’s legacy of crafting unparalleled creations. Even now, those seeking to harness its destructive energy risk being consumed by the flames beneath its surface.
#### 6. [[Ivory Reaches]]

A breathtaking region of towering white cliffs and frozen coastal plains, the Ivory Reaches are known for their serene beauty and isolation. Here, the icy winds carry whispers of the gods, and the frozen seas sparkle brilliantly under the sun. Mystics, hermits, and seekers of divine enlightenment often retreat to the Reaches, drawn by its spiritual aura and the promise of solitude in its frozen embrace.
