## Overview

Despite its humorous name, La Poo Poo was a renowned luxury restaurant situated on a picturesque hill in [[Crockyland]] during [[Landfall-230 - The Great Dominion]]. Operated by the eccentric yet brilliant Chef Poo Poo, the restaurant was famed for its unique approach: diners could order "whatever you want," provided the chef had the ingredients to prepare it. This personalized dining experience made La Poo Poo a sought-after destination for world leaders, and the familiarity led to La Poo Poo receiving offers to cater large events.

## Ambiance and Cuisine

The restaurant’s charm lay in its rustic yet refined aesthetic. With panoramic views of Crockyland’s vibrant scenery, La Poo Poo offered an intimate atmosphere that paired well with its eclectic menu. Whether it was a simple stew or an elaborate multi-course feast, Chef Poo Poo’s culinary prowess ensured every dish was a masterpiece (despite however curt he may present himself.)
