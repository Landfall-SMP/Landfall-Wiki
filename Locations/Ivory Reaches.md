## Overview

The Ivory Reaches are a majestic expanse of towering white cliffs and frozen coastal plains. The region is known for its pristine beauty and its proximity to the northern seas, where the sun's light reflects off the icy waters in a brilliant display. 

Long considered a land of isolation, the Reaches have attracted mystics and wanderers seeking solitude and enlightenment. Here, the connection to the divine feels strongest, as the icy winds are said to carry whispers from the gods themselves. 

The Ivory Reaches is home to the [[Ehrengard Empire]] and the [[Magda'roth Empire]].
