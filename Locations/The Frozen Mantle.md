## Overview

A barren and unforgiving land of eternal winter, the Frozen Mantle is defined by its vast,
icebound wilderness. Few dare to make a home here, and those who do are often hardened by the relentless cold. The land itself resists change, a place where nature stands still, untouched by time. 

The [[Weavers of the Verdant Thread]] believe the Frozen Mantle to be a symbol of patience and endurance, a place where life, though dormant, quietly persists beneath the snow and ice, waiting for the right moment to grow.
