## Overview

A volatile land shaped by ancient volcanic activity, the Emberscar Basin is a place of fiery power and destruction. The basinâ€™s ever-shifting landscape is dotted with the ruins of forges once used by the followers of the [[Conclave of the Silent Forge]]. It is said that the most powerful creations were born from this land, though few have mastered the flames that continue to smolder beneath the surface.

It was home to the [[Zatrian National Republic]], which is now [[Varenholde]].
