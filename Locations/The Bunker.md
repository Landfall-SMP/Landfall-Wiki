#L230
## Overview

Constructed by [[LobsterCo]], The Bunker was a secure underground facility designed to host diplomatic summits and high-level meetings during [[Landfall-230 - The Great Dominion]]. Located in a remote yet accessible region, its reinforced structure and state-of-the-art security systems made it ideal for sensitive negotiations. The Bunker played a role in maintaining the fragile alliances of the Great Dominion and became a neutral ground for resolving disputes between rival factions.
