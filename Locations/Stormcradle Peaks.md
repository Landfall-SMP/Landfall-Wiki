## Overview

These towering peaks are home to constant storms, believed to be remnants of divine conflicts long forgotten. The regionâ€™s jagged mountains are perilous, but its tempestuous nature has attracted those with something to prove. 

The [[Umbral Communion]] often frequents the lower ridges, using the shadows cast by the storm to commune with hidden truths, while the peaks remain largely unclaimed due to their fierce winds and dangerous paths.
