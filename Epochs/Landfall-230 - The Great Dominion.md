## Overview

The Great Dominion was less a unified entity and more a delicate balance of power among the various nations, factions, and players in [[Caldora]]. This era marked the emergence of ambitious political blocs, technological marvels, and cultural renaissances, yet these advancements were underscored by an ever-present tension. [[Lilarreich]], [[Crazy Town]], and others vied for influence, with no single group holding absolute control. Instead, the Dominion was defined by a precarious system of mutual accountability, where each faction's ambitions were kept in check by the others, fostering an environment of collaboration and rivalry.

## Major Groups

- **[[Lilarreich]]**: The dominant diplomatic and technological force in [[Caldora]], Lilarreich sought to maintain stability through structured governance and innovation, often setting the standard for others to follow.
- **[[Crazy Town]]**: A chaotic but highly inventive faction that frequently disrupted the status quo with its unpredictable inventions and unorthodox strategies. Crazy Town’s antics ensured that no single entity could consolidate too much power.
- **[[Rotatus Incorporated]]**: A valuable industrial force, Rotatus built much of Caldora’s infrastructure, playing all sides to it's benefit.
- **[[Fulcrum]]**: Once independent, Fulcrum became a vital part of Lilarreich. Known for its military prowess and technological innovations, Fulcrum contributed significantly to the Dominion’s strength.
- **[[LobsterCo]]**: A mysterious and controversial group whose experiments, such as the creation of the sculk biome, pushed the boundaries of science and morality.

## Key Events

- **[[Lilarreich-Crazy Town Cold War]]**: A rivalry of ideologies and technologies, this cold war between [[Lilarreich]] and [[Crazy Town]] led to major innovations, but also heightened tensions that nearly erupted into open conflict.

- **[[The Chancellor's Banquet]]**: An extravagant gathering held in [[Terranova]], aimed at fostering diplomacy and easing tensions between factions. While celebrated as a moment of temporary peace, it also exposed underlying grievances.
- **[[XreaTech vs. Walrus Luditus]]**: One of the most notorious legal battles in [[Caldora]], [[Zee Bane]] of [[XreaTech]] filed charges against [[Walrus Luditus]] for theft, trespassing, and airspace violations. The trial, presided over by [[Crazy Eli]], ended in chaos as Walrus detonated a bomb in the courthouse, marking one of the most dramatic and destabilizing incidents of the era.
