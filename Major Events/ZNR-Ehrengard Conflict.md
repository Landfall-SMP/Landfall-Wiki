#L530 
## Overview

The ZNR-Ehrengard Conflict was a pivotal war between the [[Zatrian National Republic]] (ZNR) and the [[Ehrengard Empire]] during the early days of [[Landfall-530 - Noble Blood]]. Sparked by territorial disputes and political differences, the conflict highlighted Ehrengard’s expansionist ambitions and the ZNR’s fierce resistance.

## Key Events

- **The Emberscar Campaign**:  
    Ehrengard’s initial push into ZNR territory, led by Lord Commander [[Klein Moretti]], aimed to secure the resource-rich [[Emberscar Basin]]. The ZNR’s guerrilla tactics delayed the Empire’s advance but came at great cost.
- **Avery Rosendahl’s Defection**:  
    The turning point came when [[Avery R. Ehrveil]], a high-ranking ZNR officer, defected to Ehrengard. Her defection brought her loyal division with her and undermined ZNR morale.
- **The Fall of the ZNR**:  
    After a series of decisive battles, the ZNR capitulated, and its lands were integrated into Ehrengard as the Duchy of [[Varenholde]]. Avery was later revealed to be Avery Ehrveil, heir to the Ehrveillian Dynasty, in what many saw as a calculated move by the Empire to consolidate power.

## Propaganda

The conflict was initiated over anti-[[Ehrengard Empire]] propaganda posted by the [[Zatrian National Republic]]. A few such posters can be found below. Note the use of red and purple, as they are the heraldic colors of the ZNR and Ehrengard respectively.
