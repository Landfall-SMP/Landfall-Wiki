#L230 
## Overview

The legal conflict between **XreaTech**, represented by its founder [[Zee Bane]], and [[Walrus Luditus]] is one of the most infamous cases in [[Landfall-230 - The Great Dominion]] history. The case centered on allegations of airspace violations, theft, and even manslaughter within XreaTech’s jurisdiction. Filed under XreaTech’s newly minted commercial code, the case sparked a heated legal battle that exposed tensions between emergent corporate nations and rogue individuals.
## Details of the Dispute

- **Plaintiff**: Zee Bane  
    Founder of [[XreaTech]], [[Zee Bane]] accused [[Walrus Luditus]] of violating XreaTech’s airspace by leaving stolen airships unattended, committing multiple acts of theft, and manslaughter of the third degree.

- **Defendant**: Walrus Luditus
    A known rogue with a penchant for bending the rules, [[Walrus Luditus]] denied the allegations, claiming extenuating circumstances such as the theft of his own airship and lack of evidence for the thefts and manslaughter accusations.

## Jurisdiction and Legal Basis

The case was filed under XreaTech’s commercial code, specifically:

- **Section 1.1, -a0001**: Theft of property.
- **Section 1.1, -a0004**: Unauthorized airspace usage.
- **Section 1.1, -a0005**: Third-degree manslaughter.

The plaintiff sought damages, specifically for the destruction of an AE2 crystal farm, and punitive measures to deter future violations.

## The Defense and Settlement Proposal

The defense, led by [[Lucius Ehrveil]] argued that:

- The laws were applied retroactively, making the charges invalid.
- Walrus’ airship was stolen, absolving him of responsibility for its presence in [[XreaTech]] airspace.
- There was insufficient evidence for the theft and manslaughter allegations.

To avoid further escalation, the defense proposed a settlement:

1. Withdrawal of charges without an admission of guilt.
2. A mutual agreement to forgo future legal claims on the matter.
## Outcome

The case of [[XreaTech]] vs. [[Walrus Luditus]] reached its dramatic conclusion when [[Crazy Eli]], the presiding judge, ruled in favor of the defense. As Eli delivered the verdict, Luditus leapt up in celebration and detonated an explosive device hidden in the back of the courthouse. The resulting chaos left the courtroom in shambles and sent the gathered crowd into a frenzy. Most present gave chase to Luditus, while Crazy Eli proudly revealed that he had been conspiring with Luditus all along.

Eli was swiftly apprehended and sentenced to imprisonment within The Drive, a spatial prison designed to isolate dangerous individuals. During his confinement, Eli penned a manifesto outlining his radical philosophies and justifications for the bombing. Upon his release, the manifesto fell into the hands of Luditus, further fueling his descent into madness.

As a form of penance, Luditus eventually constructed [[The Asylum]], a facility for those deemed too dangerous or unstable for regular society. The asylum served both as a means of self-imposed redemption and a sanctuary for others seeking rehabilitation. Luditus himself became its first resident, vowing to confront the chaos within and around him.
