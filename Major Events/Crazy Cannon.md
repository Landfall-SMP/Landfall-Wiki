#L230 
## Overview

The Crazy Cannon was an infamous creation of [[Crazy Eli]], a founding member of [[Crazy Town]], during [[Landfall-230 - The Great Dominion]]. Built as both a defensive measure and a statement of technological audacity, the Crazy Cannon was capable of firing massive payloads with devastating accuracy. It became a symbol of Crazy Town’s ingenuity and eccentricity, cementing their reputation as both innovative and unpredictable.

The cannon was most notably used to carve out [[Crazy Cave]], Crazy Eli’s hideout, which became a landmark on the border between Crazy Town and [[Terranova]]. While the cannon was rarely used in direct combat, its mere existence served as a powerful deterrent during the [[Lilarreich-Crazy Town Cold War]].
