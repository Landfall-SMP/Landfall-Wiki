#L241 
## Overview

The Sculk Horde emerged as the central threat during [[Landfall-241 - The Sculk Horde]], centuries after the fall of the Great Dominion. Originating from the uncontrolled spread of sculk biomass, which had been created by [[LobsterCo]], the Horde quickly transformed the world into a nightmarish wasteland. Entire cities fell, their inhabitants consumed or converted into monstrous entities bound to the sculk's will. [[The Survivors]] referred to the sculk as both a plague and a predator, driven by an inscrutable, ancient hunger.

## Key Features

- **Infected Biomes**:  
    The sculk reshaped the land into dark, pulsating terrain filled with hostile lifeforms. Once-vibrant regions became dangerous wastelands, and only the hardiest survived within their borders.
    
- **Sculk Symbiosis**:  
    Ancestors of [[The Survivors]] from [[Landfall-230 - The Great Dominion]], (who were frozen in cryostasis) found themselves imbued with the abilities of sculk once woken up from the infected stasis chambers.
    

## Significance

The Sculk Horde tested the resilience of [[Caldora]]â€™s remnants, forcing fractured factions to work together to survive. Their incursion led to the desperate awakening of ancient leaders in cryostasis and the reactivation of forgotten technologies from the Great Dominion. The world eventually fell to The Horde, marking the end of [[Landfall-241 - The Sculk Horde]].
