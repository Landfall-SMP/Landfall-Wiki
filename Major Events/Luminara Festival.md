#L530 
## Overview

The Luminara Festival is a celebrated annual event in the [[Ehrengard Empire]], originally established during the early days of [[Landfall-530 - Noble Blood]] to look forward to the year ahead. Held in [[New Terranova]], the festival features a board to write gratitude and aspirations, cultural performances, and a spectacular display of fireworks symbolizing hope and renewal.

## Significance

The festival is a time of reflection, celebrating the Empire’s resilience and achievements. It also serves as a reminder of Kieran’s assassination during a past Luminara Festival, a somber event that marked a turning point in Ehrengard’s history. To honor his legacy, the Empire uses the festival as an opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to unity and progress.

This event is also commonly known for being the site of Emperor [[Kieran Ehrveil]]'s assassination at the hands of [[Willy Luditus]].

## Traditions

- **Luminara Board**: Citizens write aspirations, reflections, and notes of gratitude on a board and light a candle in front of it.
- **Ceremonial Address**: The reigning Emperor or Empress delivers a speech to commemorate the Empire’s past and inspire its future.
- **Fireworks**: A moment of silence held before fireworks light up the sky.
