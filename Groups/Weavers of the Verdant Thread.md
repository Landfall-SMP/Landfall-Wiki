## Deity

- **Sylhara, The Eternal Loom**: The divine weaver of life’s interconnected tapestry.

## Theme

Growth, harmony, and the cyclical nature of life.

## Lore

The Weavers of the Verdant Thread believe that Sylhara, the Eternal Loom, weaves all life into a great, interconnected tapestry that spans time and space. Every plant, creature, and person is but a thread in this vast design, and the Weavers devote their lives to understanding their place within it. According to their lore, the world is not static but constantly growing and evolving as Sylhara spins new threads of life. The Weavers see themselves as caretakers of this growth, nurturing the wilds and ensuring the balance of the living world.

The Verdant Thread is not just a metaphor—the Weavers believe that hidden beneath the visible world is a literal, glowing network of life energy. By tuning into this energy, they can guide its flow, helping plants grow, influencing the weather, or healing the sick. Sylhara's teachings emphasize balance, patience, and the cyclical nature of life, and followers often serve as mediators between civilizations and the natural world.

## Starting Location

**The Grove of the Eternal Loom**: A magical forest where glowing vines weave through ancient trees, centered around an immense living loom believed to be Sylhara’s manifestation.
