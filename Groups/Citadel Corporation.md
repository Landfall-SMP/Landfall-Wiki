## Overview

The Citadel Corporation is a clandestine and highly centralized organization, quietly orchestrating its operations from the shadows of [[Caldora]]’s bustling power structures. While its name remains largely unknown to the general populace, Citadel’s influence pervades through its numerous Departments, often referred to internally as "Fronts." These departments act as independent entities with specific purposes, shielding Citadel’s true scope and intentions from public scrutiny.

Citadel's mission, as articulated within its secretive inner circles, is to consolidate power and resources to create a unified framework of wealth and influence. Whether operating in the financial, technological, or militaristic arenas, Citadel thrives on anonymity and precision. Its dealings, while often lawful on paper, blur the lines between ethical business and underhanded manipulation.
