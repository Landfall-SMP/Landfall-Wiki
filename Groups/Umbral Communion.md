## Deity

- **Nethrys, The Shadowed One**: Guardian of balance, dwelling in the liminal spaces between opposites.

## Theme

Shadows, balance, and the pursuit of hidden truths.

## Lore

The Umbral Communion worships Nethrys, a deity of shadows, balance, and the veil between light and dark. Followers believe that Nethrys weaves the unseen forces of the world, residing in the liminal spaces between day and night, life and death, and truth and illusion. According to the Communion, true power comes not from choosing one side but from embracing the balance between opposites—light and shadow are intertwined, and neither can exist without the other.

Nethrys is said to have walked the world in ancient times, shrouded in a cloak of living shadow, imparting secret knowledge to those who could peer beyond the surface of reality. Her followers, known as Shadowmancers, seek to unlock hidden truths and maintain the delicate balance that governs the world. They view themselves as guardians of equilibrium, intervening when any force—whether of light or dark—grows too powerful.

The Umbral Communion holds that shadows are more than mere absence of light; they are alive, imbued with the echoes of past and future events. Through communion with the shadows, followers gain insight into the mysteries of the world and can manipulate the unseen to achieve their goals. They are often called upon to mediate disputes or resolve conflicts, always seeking to restore balance and order.

## Starting Location

**The Umbral Sanctuary**: A temple carved into a cliff where light and shadow blend in dynamic harmony, with hidden chambers accessible only through mastery of shadow paths.
