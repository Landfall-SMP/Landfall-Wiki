## Overview

The Mirage Concord is a theocratic cooperative dedicated to the worship of Volkar, The Silent Smith, and Kaelix, The Warden of Ash—known locally as Forge and Hammer ([[Conclave of the Silent Forge]]). The Concord operates under the guidance of a Triumvirate and emphasizes collective growth, industrial progression, and the reverence of ancient relics. Its core mission is to thrive in the harsh desert environment through unity, automation, and the integration of divine inspiration into everyday life. Mirage Concord was founded by [[Ashen Caldwell]].

## Core Principles

1. **Divine Reverence**: Every home must include an altar or symbol honoring the Silent Forge.
2. **Unity and Equality**: Wealth and hardship are shared equally to ensure survival in the desert.
3. **Reverence for Relics**: Ancient artifacts are divine remnants to be studied, restored, and respected.
4. **Automation for Prosperity**: Machines that ease labor are seen as gifts from Forge and Hammer.
5. **Expansion**: The Concord seeks to extend its influence beyond the desert to other planes and regions.

## Oath of Citizenship

“I pledge myself to the Forge and the Hammer, to Volkar and Kaelix, to Craft and Strife, for they are chief among divinity... I pledge to view the success of all within the Concord as my own success. I am a Citizen of the Mirage Concord and will create great works in our name.”

## Foreign Relations

The Concord maintains neutrality but will defend its people and faith. Nations impeding the worship of Forge may face diplomatic tensions, and, if unresolved, could be declared Heretic States and subject to Crusade.
