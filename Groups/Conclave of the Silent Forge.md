## Deities

- **Volkar, The Silent Smith**: Master of creation, forging life and matter from raw elements.
- **Kaelix, The Warden of Ash**: Overseer of destruction, ensuring that all things return to the Forge of Eternity to be remade.

## Theme

Creation, transformation, and the eternal balance between forging and renewal.

## Lore

The Conclave of the Silent Forge worships two deities: Volkar, the Silent Smith, and Kaelix, the Warden of Ash. Together, these gods embody the eternal cycle of creation and destruction that shapes the world. Volkar is the master of creation, the one who forges life and matter from raw elements. His forge, hidden deep within the heart of the cosmos, is so powerful that even silence itself carries the weight of creation. The Conclave teaches that Volkar never speaks because his words alone could reshape reality—the silence of his forge is where the purest creations take form.

However, the Conclave also acknowledges that nothing lasts forever. Kaelix, the Warden of Ash, governs the forces of destruction, but not as a malevolent force. Instead, Kaelix oversees the necessary end of all things, ensuring that what has fulfilled its purpose returns to the Forge of Eternity to be melted down, recycled, and remade by Volkar. Destruction is seen as the precursor to new beginnings, and followers of the Conclave believe that balance between creation and destruction is essential to maintaining the world.

The followers of the Silent Forge dedicate themselves to both gods, honoring Volkar through their acts of crafting, building, and innovation, while offering spent materials and failed creations to Kaelix to be consumed by the fires of renewal. The Conclave believes that they are aiding both gods in shaping the world—by creating, they honor Volkar’s silent masterpiece; by destroying, they honor Kaelix’s vigilant renewal.

## Holy Site

**The Forge of Eternity**: An underground complex of molten rivers, massive anvils, and eternal furnaces. The Furnace of Ash, a sacred chamber, serves as a site for sacrifices to Kaelix.
