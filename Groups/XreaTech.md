#L230 
## Overview

Founded during [[Landfall-230 - The Great Dominion]] by [[Zee Bane]], XreaTech was an ambitious nation built on principles of self-reliance and technological innovation. Situated near [[Terranova]], it quickly distinguished itself with its self-sustaining infrastructure, including an advanced power plant, a bustling market, and a carefully designed housing district.

At the heart of XreaTech lay its heavily fortified bunker, a symbol of the nation’s emphasis on security and progress. This facility served dual purposes: a safeguard against external threats and a hub for experimental research.

Despite its independence, XreaTech’s development was not without controversy. While some hailed Zee Bane as a visionary who sought to redefine freedom through innovation, others criticized the nation’s reliance on aid from [[Lilarreich]] to sustain its ambitious projects. These critiques led to a divided legacy, with XreaTech seen as both a beacon of progress and a cautionary tale of overreach.
