## Overview

The Survivors are the descendants of the once-mighty [[Landfall-230 - The Great Dominion]], united by the desperate struggle to ensure the future of [[Caldora]]. As their ancestors faced the encroaching collapse of the Dominion, they devised a bold plan: placing the brightest minds, most influential leaders, and powerful warriors in cryostasis, ensuring their preservation for a brighter era. However, the plan faltered as the world succumbed to the relentless spread of the [[Sculk Horde]], forcing the Survivors to awaken their champions earlier than intended.

Now, with their resources dwindling and their enemies growing stronger, the Survivors fight a desperate battle to reclaim their world.
