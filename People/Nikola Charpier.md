## Overview

Nikola Charpier is the last surviving member of the once-influential Charpier lineage, a family renowned for their dedication to the improvement of regimes and the growth of prosperity worldwide. The Charpiers were deeply interwoven with businesses and movements aimed at uplifting societies, often putting themselves at risk for the greater good. Their noble mission, however, came at a heavy price, with many of Nikola’s ancestors succumbing to natural causes or falling victim to assassinations tied to their relentless pursuit of change.

Now standing alone as the final Charpier, Nikola has taken upon himself the monumental task of preserving and perpetuating his family's legacy. Determined to make a lasting impact, Nikola works tirelessly to deliver one final act that will honor the Charpiers’ ideals and ensure their contributions to the world are remembered. He is Viscount of a small region within [[New Terranova]], home to his own Blacklung division within [[Citadel Corporation]].
