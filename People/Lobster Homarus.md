#L530 
## Overview

Lobster Homarus, also often referred to as _Mr. Lobster,_ lives in [[Landfall-530 - Noble Blood]] and seems to have adopted a more formal first name than his ancestor [[Lobbar Homarus]] from [[Landfall-230 - The Great Dominion]]. He is often found wearing a purple mask and a more gray trench coat than his predecessor, and is credited with rebuilding [[LobsterCo]] in his epoch.
