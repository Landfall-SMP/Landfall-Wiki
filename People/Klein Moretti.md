## Overview
Klein Moretti is an Ehrengardian war hero whose valor and decisive actions led to the defeat of the [[Zatrian National Republic]] (ZNR), earning him the prestigious title of Lord Commander. A man of mystery, Klein’s origins remain unknown, yet his loyalty to [[Ehrengard Empire]] and his remarkable leadership have cemented his place in the annals of the Empire’s history.

## Background

Klein appeared seemingly from nowhere, bringing with him an unshakable resolve and an uncanny ability to inspire those around him. His rise through the ranks of Ehrengard’s military was swift, driven by his strategic brilliance and dedication to the Empire’s cause. Klein played a pivotal role in the campaign against the ZNR, demonstrating not only tactical acumen but also a deep sense of empathy for his comrades. He began as an agent for Ehrengardian intelligence but quickly gained citizenship to join the Security Council and lead the charge. This made him indispensable to Ehrengard’s military efforts.

## Role in the ZNR Conflict

Klein’s leadership during the [[ZNR-Ehrengard Conflict]] was marked by both his tactical genius and his ability to unify disparate forces. His decisive victory over the ZNR’s defenses turned the tide of the war, leading to the peaceful integration of the [[Emberscar Basin]] into Ehrengard as [[Varenholde]]. Recognizing his unmatched contributions, Emperor [[Kieran Ehrveil]] appointed Klein as Lord Commander, entrusting him and [[Avery R. Ehrveil]] with the security and stability of the newly annexed region. After Kieran's passing, Avery named Klein the Duke of Varenholde.

## Personality and Quirks

Klein’s demeanor is calm and collected, exuding a quiet confidence that inspires trust. Despite his military prowess and formal title, Klein is approachable and grounded, often surprising those around him with his simplicity. His fondness for bread and gold-coated carrots has become something of a legend within Ehrengard, with many recounting his uncanny ability to procure and enjoy a fresh loaf even in the midst of battle.

Klein’s attire strikes a balance between formality and casual confidence. He is often seen wearing a deep black suit, its slightly oversized jacket lending an air of relaxed authority. Beneath it, a crisp white shirt adds a structured, polished contrast. His understated yet commanding presence is a reflection of his character: pragmatic, composed, and entirely unpretentious.

## Legacy

As Lord Commander, Klein Moretti continues to safeguard the Empire’s interests, overseeing the defense of [[Varenholde]] and mentoring future generations of Ehrengardian leaders. His unassuming charm and devotion to duty make him a beloved figure within the Empire, and his enduring affection for bread serves as a reminder of his humble, grounded nature amidst the grandeur of [[Ehrengard Empire]].
