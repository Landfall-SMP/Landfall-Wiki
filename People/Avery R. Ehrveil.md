## Background

Avery’s journey to the throne was neither conventional nor privileged. Her father, Emperor [[Kieran Ehrveil]], sought to forge a leader capable of ruling with both strength and empathy. To achieve this, he placed her under a false identity and far from the luxury of court life. Raised as **Avery Rosendahl** in the [[Zatrian National Republic]] (ZNR), she grew up among its people, trained under its military, and learned leadership through lived experience.

### The ZNR Conflict and Defection

During the escalating conflict between [[Ehrengard Empire]] and the ZNR, Avery commanded a loyal division of troops, unaware of her true heritage. The turning point came when Lord Commander [[Klein Moretti]], a Zatrian officer who had defected to Ehrengard, convinced Avery that joining Ehrengard would secure stability for the ZNR’s people.

With the Republic crumbling and her soldiers depending on her, Avery chose to defect to Ehrengard alongside Klein and her forces. Unbeknownst to her, this decision was part of a carefully orchestrated test by her father to prepare her for her future role as Empress.

### Duchess of Varenholde

Following the swift surrender of the ZNR, Avery was named Duchess of [[Varenholde]], the newly integrated region of Ehrengard that encompassed the ZNR’s former territories. Her leadership in rebuilding the war-torn region and fostering its integration into the Empire proved her capability as a ruler. Even after her father revealed her true identity, Avery chose to maintain the name "Rosendahl," honoring the bonds she had forged and the lessons she had learned during her time in the ZNR.

### Ascension to the Throne

The assassination of Emperor [[Kieran Ehrveil]] during the [[Luminara Festival]] thrust Avery into the spotlight as his rightful heir. Years of proving her worth as Duchess of [[Varenholde]] prepared her to assume the mantle of Empress, not merely through her bloodline but through the respect and loyalty she had earned.

As Empress, Avery elevated [[Klein Moretti]] to high nobility, entrusting him with the continued stewardship of Varenholde as its Duke. She took on the name **Avery R. Ehrveil**, symbolizing her unification of the past and present as she began her reign.
