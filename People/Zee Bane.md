#L230

Zee Bane, an entrepreneurial figure, began their journey in [[Lilarreich]], residing in [[Terranova]] for a brief period during [[Landfall-230 - The Great Dominion]]. Zee quickly grew restless within the constraints of the city and departed Lilarreich to establish [[XreaTech]], an independent nation.

Zee prioritized creating self-sustaining infrastructure. While Zee maintained cordial relations with Lilarreich, their departure was seen by some as a quiet critique of the Dominionâ€™s more traditional structures. Zee himself was often found in a suit accented in blue to match his skintight face mask.
